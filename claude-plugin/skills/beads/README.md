# Beads Skill for Claude Code

A comprehensive skill for using [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/fastbeads) (fbd) issue tracking with Claude Code.

## What This Skill Does

This skill teaches Claude Code how to use fbd effectively for:
- **Multi-session work tracking** - Persistent memory across conversation compactions
- **Dependency management** - Graph-based issue relationships
- **Session handoff** - Writing notes that survive context resets
- **Molecules and wisps** (v0.34.0+) - Reusable work templates and ephemeral workflows

## Installation

Copy the `beads/` directory to your Claude Code skills location:

```bash
# Global installation
cp -r beads ~/.claude/skills/

# Or project-local
cp -r beads .claude/skills/
```

## When Claude Uses This Skill

The skill activates when conversations involve:
- "multi-session", "complex dependencies", "resume after weeks"
- "project memory", "persistent context", "side quest tracking"
- Work that spans multiple days or compaction cycles
- Tasks too complex for simple TodoWrite lists

## Key Concepts

### fbd vs TodoWrite

| Use fbd when... | Use TodoWrite when... |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Work spans multiple sessions | Single-session tasks |
| Complex dependencies exist | Linear step-by-step work |
| Need to resume after weeks | Just need a quick checklist |
| Knowledge work with fuzzy boundaries | Clear, immediate tasks |

### The Dependency Direction Trap

`fbd dep add A B` means **"A depends on B"** (B must complete before A can start).

```bash
# Want: "Setup must complete before Implementation"
fbd dep add implementation setup  # ✓ CORRECT
# NOT: fbd dep add setup implementation  # ✗ WRONG
```

### Surviving Compaction

When Claude's context gets compacted, conversation history is lost but fbd state survives. Write notes as if explaining to a future Claude with zero context:

```bash
fbd update issue-123 --notes "COMPLETED: JWT auth with RS256
KEY DECISION: RS256 over HS256 for key rotation
IN PROGRESS: Password reset flow
NEXT: Implement rate limiting"
```

## Requirements

- [fbd CLI](https://github.com/steveyegge/fastbeads) installed (`brew install beads`)
- A git repository (fbd requires git for sync)
- Initialized database (`fbd init` in project root)

## Version Compatibility
