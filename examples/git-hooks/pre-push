# fbd (beads) pre-push hook
#
# This hook prevents pushing stale JSONL by:
# 1. Flushing any pending in-memory changes to JSONL (if fbd available)
# 2. Checking for uncommitted changes (staged, unstaged, untracked, deleted)
# 3. Failing the push with clear instructions if changes found
#
# When sync-branch is configured in config.yaml, .beads changes are committed
# to a separate branch via worktree, so the uncommitted check is skipped.
#
# The pre-commit hook already exports changes, but this catches:
# - Changes made between commit and push
# - Pending debounced flushes (5s daemon delay)
#
# Installation:
#   cp examples/git-hooks/pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push
#   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
#
# Or use the install script:
#   examples/git-hooks/install.sh
