	Short:   "Check and manage fbd version upgrades",
	Long: `Commands for checking fbd version upgrades and reviewing changes.

The upgrade command helps you stay aware of fbd version changes:
  - fbd upgrade status: Check if fbd version changed since last use
  - fbd upgrade review: Show what's new since your last version
  - fbd upgrade ack: Acknowledge the current version

Version tracking is automatic - fbd updates metadata.json on every run.`,
}

var upgradeStatusCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "status",
	Short: "Check if fbd version has changed",
	Long: `Check if fbd has been upgraded since you last used it.

This command uses the version tracking that happens automatically
at startup to detect if fbd was upgraded.

Examples:
  fbd upgrade status
  fbd upgrade status --json`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		// Use in-memory state from trackBdVersion() which runs in PersistentPreRun
		if jsonOutput {

				result["changes_available"] = len(getVersionsSince(previousVersion)) > 0
			}
			outputJSON(result)
			return
		}

var upgradeReviewCmd = &cobra.Command{

	Short: "Review changes since last fbd version",
	Long: `Show what's new in fbd since the last version you used.

Unlike 'fbd info --whats-new' which shows the last 3 versions,
this command shows ALL changes since your specific last version.

If you're upgrading from an old version, you'll see the complete
changelog of everything that changed since then.

Examples:
  fbd upgrade review
  fbd upgrade review --json`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		// Use in-memory state from trackBdVersion() which runs in PersistentPreRun
		lastVersion := previousVersion

				"current_version":  Version,
				"previous_version": lastVersion,

var upgradeAckCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "ack",
	Short: "Acknowledge the current fbd version",
	Long: `Mark the current fbd version as acknowledged.

This updates metadata.json to record that you've seen the current
version. Mainly useful after reviewing upgrade changes to suppress
future upgrade notifications.

Note: Version tracking happens automatically, so you don't need to
run this command unless you want to explicitly mark acknowledgement.

Examples:
  fbd upgrade ack
  fbd upgrade ack --json`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		beadsDir := beads.FindBeadsDir()

		cfg.LastBdVersion = Version

		if err := cfg.Save(beadsDir); err != nil {
