# fbd (beads) post-merge hook - thin shim
#
# This shim delegates to 'fbd hook post-merge' which contains
# the actual hook logic. This pattern ensures hook behavior is always
# in sync with the installed fbd version - no manual updates needed.
#
# The 'fbd hook' command (singular) supports:
# - Branch-then-merge pattern for Dolt (cell-level conflict resolution)
# - Per-worktree state tracking
# - Hook chaining configuration

# Check if fbd is available
